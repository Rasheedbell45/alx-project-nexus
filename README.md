A documentation hub for my major learnings from the **ProDev Frontend Engineering Program**.  
This repository highlights my understanding of frontend engineering concepts, tools, challenges, and best practices gained during the program.

## Program Overview

The **ProDev Frontend Engineering Program** provided a comprehensive foundation in modern frontend development.  
It emphasized building scalable, performant, and user-friendly applications while applying industry best practices and collaboration workflows.

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies
- **Web Development**: React, Next.js, TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS, CSS Modules
- **API Handling**: REST APIs, GraphQL, Apollo Client
- **Mobile Development**: React Native
- **PWA (Progressive Web Apps)**: Offline-first apps, service workers
- **System Design & Analysis**
- **Version Control & Collaboration**: Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions

### Important Concepts
- Component-driven development
- State management with Redux, Zustand
- Responsive design & accessibility
- API integration best practices
- Authentication & Authorization
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Performance optimization
- System design for scalability

## Challenges & Solutions
- **API Integration**: Built reusable hooks for error/loading states.
- **State Management**: Adopted Zustand & Redux patterns for clarity.
- **Styling Consistency**: Standardized TailwindCSS utility classes.
- **CI/CD**: Automated builds with GitHub Actions and deployed via Vercel.

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways
- Write clean, reusable, maintainable code.
- Adopt component-driven architecture.
- Prioritize accessibility (a11y).
- Use clear Git commit messages & branching strategies.
- Document technical decisions for future reference.

# Real-World Application Case Study

This case study simulates building a **dynamic e-commerce product catalog**. It demonstrates how to balance functional requirements with user experience.

## Project Goals
- **API Integration**: Fetch and display product data dynamically.
- **User Convenience**: Implement filtering and sorting for product discovery.
- **Enhanced Experience**: Deliver a responsive, user-friendly interface with seamless navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **React / React Native**
- **Redux**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## Key Features
1. **API Data Integration**  
   - Fetch product data from a backend API  
   - Smooth loading with error and loading states  

2. **Filtering & Sorting**  
   - Category-based filtering  
   - Price sorting (asc/desc)  
   - Multi-criteria filters  

3. **Pagination & Infinite Scrolling**  
   - Page-based navigation  
   - Infinite scroll for seamless browsing  

4. **Responsive Design**  
   - Fully adaptive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile  

## Implementation Process

### Git Commit Workflow
- **Initial Setup**  
  - `feat: set up project structure with React and TypeScript`  
  - `feat: add API integration for fetching product data`

- **Feature Development**  
  - `feat: implement product filtering and sorting functionality`  
  - `feat: add pagination and infinite scrolling`

- **UI Enhancements**  
  - `style: enhance UI with Tailwind CSS`
